It was the first year that the Coalition&#8217;s cuts had really hit, public libraries were in danger and people were in shock or getting angry.  Alan Gibbons suggested a national day of protest for libraries, then called Save Our Libraries Day, and it happened &#8211; <a title=\"Guardian - Save Our Libraries Day as it happened\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture-cuts-blog/2011/feb/05/save-our-libraries-day-live-coverage\">hundreds of events and protests around the country</a>.  It was an amazing event and I am very pleased to say that I played a part, albeit a tiny one, in it. That day served its purpose and did great work for public libraries.  I&#8217;m pleased, though,  to say that over the last years, the day has  grown from being a protest to being a day of celebration of this great national service.  Some councils had difficulty adjusting to this at the start: there was some suspicion of politics but that has largely all gone. Pretty much every authority I know of now sees National Libraries Day as an important day in their calendar and so it should be.  It is the only time that we have <em>just to celebrate our service.  </em>Not books, not computers, not digital inclusion but the whole darn thing.  The wonderful service that is provided and too many once took for granted and too many now take as something that can be endangered. Make sure you get to the library on the day, look around, smile that it&#8217;s still there and work out how you can make it better.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barnsley </strong>- <a title=\"Star\" href=\"http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/new-library-is-set-to-be-the-beacon-of-barnsley-1-7061123\">New central library announced as landmark of £50m town centre redevelopment</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Manchester </strong>- <a title=\"MEN\" href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-library-visitor-numbers-fall-8491284\">Deep drop in numbers of users at seven volunteer-run libraries. </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Chron\" href=\"http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/woodlands/news/article/Library-offers-new-way-to-share-books-6012872.php\"><strong>Lending out Little Free Libraries</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Correction</strong></p>\n<p>For some reason I said Salford was undergoing a second round cuts in the first line of the last post.

At a grocery store, we go in, get what we need, and leave. A kitchen, on the other hand, is a place of interaction, discovery, creativity and shared experiences. Traditionally our relationship to our libraries is more like the former: it’s a place where we go to borrow books, movies or music, do research or maybe use the computer. A stop at the library is often more like an errand than an experience. Jack Martin wants to shift our perception to the kitchen model. “We want to be perceived as this major cultural center where people can attend learning programs, and experience exhibitions and programs inspired by the exhibitions,” he explains. “We also want to create a beautiful community space where people can access technology, gather and learn together, read together.”&#8221;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Irish Examiner\" href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/public-spreads-the-word-on-novel-little-libraries-308042.html\"><strong>Public spreads the word on novel little libraries</strong></a> &#8211; Irish Examiner (Eire). &#8220;“Parents love it — it teaches children about sharing.

No doubt &#8220;book clubs&#8221; would do even worse &#8212; but they wouldn&#8217;t be measured against the same targets, thus sparing Swansea council embarrassment.&#8221; Library News / Private Eye issue no. 1384</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Thurrock Gazette\" href=\"http://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/news/11744151.Campaign_to_keep_Thurrock_libraries_open_begins/\"><strong>Thurrock &#8211; Campaign to keep Thurrock libraries open begins</strong> </a>- Thurrock Gazette. &#8220;Thurrock Council has begun a month-long consultation with the public into how the library service can save £500,000 &#8230; Among Facebook users writing on the Thurrock Gazette website, Annette Columbine wrote: “Really!

Since 1215 every effort to undermine its impact has failed;  monarchs who tried to suppress discussion of it were rewarded by civil war and the execution of Charles I.</p>\n<p>Magna Carta is still cited by politicians and lawyers in support of constitutional positions, even though almost all its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries.  It is described as &#8220;the greatest constitutional document of all times – the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot&#8221; (Lord Denning, 1956).

I also impute to our current leaders a similar motivation:  the desire to reduce the rights of citizens and consolidate their own power.</p>\n<p>I claim that, in its own minor way, the 1964 Act should share some of Magna Carta&#8217;s iconic status.

In Staffordshire, meanwhile, library users are awaiting the final decision, due by February, after a consultation over plans to give individuals and community groups the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to take over 24 less busy libraries (unsurprisingly ones in small rural communities) leaving just 19 properly staffed and managed by the council.&#8221; <strong>Private Eye </strong>&#8220;Library News&#8221; Issue No. 1383 p.28\n</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>\nHelp spread the message that reading for even just six minutes is good for you.

The BL are, it has been <a title=\"BP report\" href=\"http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regional-affairs/british-library-could-offer-lifeline-8394050\">reported in the Birmingham Post</a>, looking at putting a &#8220;regional centre&#8221; in there.  Whatever this may turn out to be (and such a thing would naturally cause a precedent for elsewhere in the UK) it&#8217;s hopefully going to be a good thing. For, the BL has always seemed a little, well, stand-offish to me in public library circles, especially for those of us in still what is occasionally called &#8220;the provinces&#8221;.  This has, though, recently been changing.  Their business and intellectual property centres scattered around the country,<a title=\"BIPC\" href=\"http://www.bipcnewcastle.co.uk/\"> like this one in Newcastle</a>, are in libraries and, although reluctantly, they are now in charge of the <a title=\"PLR\" href=\"https://www.plr.uk.com/\">Public Lending Right Unit</a>. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that their chief executive, Roly Keating, was amongst the panel for the recent<a title=\"DCMS\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-library-report-for-england\"> Independent Report on Public libraries</a>. I&#8217;ve seen what an impact having a state library concerned with strategy and supporting public libraries can have, after looking into the <a title=\"Championing Your Library report\" href=\"http://plconnect.slq.qld.gov.au/manage/championing\">excellent work of the State Library of Queensland</a> and it&#8217;s a shame there&#8217;s nothing like it here. Such a relationship of research, support and expertise can made a big impact but it&#8217;s almost completely lacking here.  In fact, for most public library staff, the British Library is known for only one thing &#8211; being an insanely expensive lender of last resort which mercilessly penalises lost books.  The BL could be of so much more use for public libraries, but if it is content for now merely to rescue the largest public library in the European Union then that&#8217;s a great start.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cumbria </strong>- <a title=\"ITV News\" href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/border/update/2015-01-06/art-project-in-carlisle-awarded-40-000/\">£40k Arts Council funding for art workshops etc for hard to reach groups.</a></li>\n<li><strong>York &#8211; </strong><a title=\"York Press\" href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/11703618.Customers_have_their_say_on_revamped_library/\">York Explore Library and Archive reopens after £2m revamp inc. 6000 books/maps online. </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Suffolk Libraries\" href=\"http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/announcements/lively-library-sports-taster-sessions-at-chantry-and-ipswich-libraries\">Kurling, boccia and table tennis tasters</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Correction </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had incorrectly listed the threatened Bob Lawrence Library as in Brent.

         "encoded": "<p><strong>Editorial</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Congratulations to the four people below who have been named in the New Year&#8217;s Honours List and have connections to public libraries.  All of the honours are richly deserved and reflect service over and above the norm.  However, the decision to honour the Staffordshire chief (currently managing deep cuts to her service &#8211; although the award was for work elsewhere) and the chair of one of the first volunteer-run libraries has raised some eyebrows.  The feeling is that the Government, intentionally or otherwise, is reinforcing a message already received loud and clear in many library services that the move towards volunteer run libraries is to be praised and a positive response to deep funding cuts. This represents a challenge for public library campaigners who need to argue loudly for paid staff, an argument that given the hostile climate now needs strong evidence and clear arguments to succeed.  This email I received highlights the challenge:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;The professional librarians answer to less money and lower library usage is not very clear. If anything their answer appears to be defensive and unsatisfactory i.e. if the taxpayer won’t give us the money to run all the libraries the way we would like then we should close the smaller libraries and retrench to just running the bigger libraries in the traditional way. Whilst that may be a neat and tidy solution for professional librarians I’m not convinced it is the optimum policy for residents.&#8221; <em><strong>Personal email received</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>Anyway, here&#8217;s a look at the Honours winners in more detail:</p>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">-<a title=\"Newspaper\" href=\"http://www.staffordshirenewsletter.co.uk/Staffordshire-workers-recognised-new-year-s/story-25782402-detail/story.html\">Janene Cox &#8211; Order of the British Empire</a> &#8211; &#8220;For services to Libraries&#8221; &#8211; Janene has not only been responsible for Staffordshire Libraries but is also the Past President of the Society of Chief Librarians and a panel member in the recent Sieghart Independent Report on Public Libraries. The SCL (and Sieghart) has been notably pragmatic about changes to public library funding, accepting (at least in England) the need for volunteers and has maintained a professional and moderate attitude to the deepest cuts in public libraries in living history.  It has concentrated instead on pushing the reasons why public libraries are important to local and national agendas. More locally, 24 out of 43 of the libraries in Staffordshire are currently being considered for passing to volunteers and there are recently announced plans (see below) for the complete withdrawal of the mobile library service.  This makes it one of the authorities facing the deepest cuts in England and Janene is in charge of it (although she is Commissioner for Tourism and Culture now so presumably does not have direct operational control).  Having said that, it&#8217;s hard to find a senior library manager not having to cope with serious cuts at the moment or in the recent past and the award is for her work with the SCL. It&#8217;s also worth bearing in mind that, although senior in library circles, Janene is just another officer when it comes to what her bosses want &#8211; so if she&#8217;s told she has to significantly cut the service then she has not choice but to do the best she can.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Newspaper report\" href=\"http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/dedicated-volunteer-chalfont-st-giles-8360339\">Tony Hoare &#8211; British Empire Medal </a>- &#8220;For services to the community&#8221; &#8211; Organiser of the group that saved Chalfont St Giles Library when Buckinghamshire Council wanted to close it several years ago.

         "encoded": "<p><strong>Editorial</strong></p>\n<p>It has been as ever, a year showing wide variation, internationally and nationally.  With there being 151 library services in England alone, it could hardly be otherwise.  However, having read everything UK public library related over the last year, here are my key themes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The fight for library <em>buildings</em> has (sort of) been won but t</strong><strong>he fight for adequately funded library services has never looked so fragile.</strong> Councils just aren&#8217;t closing many libraries: Cipfa estimated just 49 (1%) closed in 2013/14, 74 the year before.  That&#8217;s a lot less than most people would believe.  It shows that councils realise the tremendous detrimental political impact of closing a library.  However, this is not to say that we should all be celebrating because, faced with massive cuts from central government and strong pressure not to increase council tax, councils are cutting libraries in other ways.  The obvious one is to replace paid staff with volunteers, and that trend has only been growing this year, but other ways include cutting bookfunds (down to its lowest level for decades), When you see a flagship mega building like the Library of Birmingham having its opening hours cut almost in half, you know times are tough.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Times are looking good for new English library trusts</strong> &#8211; Although Wigan are taking library services back from the trust there, overall there&#8217;s never been as much pressure on councils to divest library services. Suffolk and York are being touted, most recently in the Sieghart Independent Report, as the great new hope &#8230; and the benefits they bring in terms of reduced costs are being scrutinised all around the country.  In Scotland, where slightly different rules apply, trusts now commonly run libraries: expect a flood of these south of the border in the next couple of years.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A lack of amalgamations</strong>. There&#8217;s been a surprising lack of different councils merging library services for economies of scale.  Perhaps there&#8217;s a strong element of turkeys not voting for Christmas in this one.  It is notable that GLL  are eyeing at least one more service but no-one has yet publicly announced they&#8217;re doing another Tri-Borough.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Private companies failing to make a dent </strong>- The US private library company, LSSI, has failed to pick up a single library service in the UK while<a title=\"PLN on Carillion\" href=\"http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/campaigning/privatized-libraries-outsourcing-library-services/carillion-and-libraries\"> Carillion &#8211; who bought out Laing last year with weeks of the latter taking over Croydon </a>- have failed to expand.  There are suspicions that challenging councils in, for example, Lincolnshire is opening the door for private companies further down the line (the reasoning being that they can competitively tender against trusts etc) but there&#8217;s been no actual sign of this yet.  One to watch, though.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Usage falls as funding falls &#8211; </strong><a title=\"PLN stats\" href=\"http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/useful/statistics\">Usage in England continues to fall roughly in line with reductions in funding</a>, but usage in the US, Wales and Australia and other countries is stable or is increasing roughly in line with increases in funding.  The evidence is there that you get what you pay for: if you fail to fund libraries adequately then the public notice and cease coming meaning you get less customers and there&#8217;s more reason to reduce funding,  The vicious circle is there for all to see.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dark times continue to be ahead</strong> &#8211; Both main political parties are committed to austerity and thus further cuts to council budgets until 2020.  Neither are willing to protect libraries from those cuts which means that you can expect, if anything, <em>deeper</em> cuts in the sector in the next parliament than this, certainly if the Conservatives win.  If Labour win then there is a chance their cuts will be less draconian but it is unlikely to feel better at the time.  We can hope, though.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Protest <em>works</em>. </strong>The success of <a title=\"PLN on judical reviews\" href=\"http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/library-closing/legal/legal-current-uk-situation\">the judicial review in Lincolnshire </a>and of protests in Liverpool and Wales show that, actually, the key thing to protect your library is to protest cuts.  Simply using the library more has some impact but there&#8217;s been enough examples this year of well-used libraries going under threat to show that it&#8217;s not key.  Indeed, a well-used library may even be more at risk as the council thinks volunteers would be more likely to save it.  No, the key thing to keeping a library open is the presence of loud, well-organised protest groups.  This is going to be especially obvious until the General Elections next year but then expect it to be lot <em>less </em>important as politicians get down to the dirty work: the loss or not of judicial review (still going through parliament) will have a great bearing on whether local people are listened to or not in non-election years.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Lack of government intervention &#8230;? </strong>The DCMS has continued its hands off policy (otherwise known as malevolent neglect) on public libraries, with a stated belief that local authorities are the best to handle local services, regardless of any statutory responsibility it may have.  Having said that, <a title=\"PLN report on Sieghart\" href=\"http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/2014/12/special-on-sieghart-the-independent-library-report.html\">the Independent Report on Public lIbraries </a>was commissioned &#8211; but then only published the last day possible before Christmas.  The Report itself was also deeply pragmatic and conservative (small c)  in tone but, even then, the libraries minister has only agreed to one recommendation so far &#8211; and that is one which has no cost attached.  However, <a title=\"DCMS local inquiry\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-inquiry-into-library-provision-in-sheffield\">Mr Vaizey has continued annoying Sheffield council with queries </a>about its consultation on deep cuts to its library service and he has still not categorically said he will not intervene,</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"NLD\" href=\"http://www.nationallibrariesday.org.uk/\"><strong>National Libraries Day gaining acceptance</strong></a>.  Most library services ran at least one event in 2014 and I expect only the most reactionary and cautious councils to ignore it in 2015.  From its roots a few years ago as an instrument of protest, the Day is becoming used as an important advocacy tool locally and nationally.  A good thing to see. Similarly, <a title=\"A to Z\" href=\"http://www.libraryatoz.org/\">the launch of the Library A to Z</a>, crowd-funded largely by campaigners, has also gained widespread support in many public libraries &#8211; probably because it is very carefully apolitical and concentrates on the positive rather than the negative.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"SCL\" href=\"http://www.goscl.com/\"><strong>National organisations are upping their game</strong></a>. Although those going through PLUIO (Public Library Universal Information Offers) training may not appreciate it, because the online modules are sometimes cloggy and mind-numbingly tedious, the SCL have tried their best to make an impact on local councillor views and nationally.  <a title=\"CILIP\" href=\"http://www.cilip.org.uk/\">The same can be said to some extent of CILIP who have been active</a>, with Big Debates and other stuff, this year. The professional association&#8217;s obsession with navel gazing &#8211; sorry, modernisation &#8211; has also now apparently come to an end and has, at least, left the organisation on a firm financial footing.  Praise must also go out to the Carnegie UK Trust who have put their back into the <a title=\"LibraryLab\" href=\"http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/changing-minds/knowledge---culture/the-future-of-libraries/carnegie-library-lab\">LibraryLab innovation grants</a>, leadership training and their advocacy work.

In Jesmond volunteers came forward; there are 10 directors in the organisation, an advisory committee, 90 volunteers who do shifts, 100 founders and donators. The Library is a community hub, a place where people come for all kinds of activities (it has a varied programme of events). There are less politics, meaning the Friends of Jesmond Library are able to react more quickly and more decisively than a council can. The Library is able to innovate and be flexible. It has movable shelves, the space is easy to adapt and the Friends try to open up the range of activities offered.&#8221; Conversely, the view was expressed that &#8220;going down the volunteer-run libraries route is equivalent in the longer term to committing to no libraries at all.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Everybody thinks they know how to run a library because they&#8217;ve been in one&#8221;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Guardian\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/28/arts-boost-nations-health-nhs-funding-arts-council\"><strong>Use the arts to boost the nation’s health</strong></a> &#8211; Guardian /Peter Bazalgette. &#8220;there’s now an initiative called <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.booksonprescription.org.uk/\"><span style=\"color: #0066cc;\">Books on Prescription</span></a>, available across England.

It isn’t. It’s true, after all. This attack on the Library of Birmingham is an attack on the very idea of self-improvement. The classically Tory possibility that anyone can better herself \u00ad– with a minimum of help from the state – itself is attacked by it. I said earlier, I’m no politician.

The answer therefore is that PLN is my leisure time.  Before, you see, I would slob out in front of TV or play computer games (strategy games mainly: I don&#8217;t have the quickest of reflexes) and now in some ways I have simply contributed one form of computer activity for another.  But of course this is far more rewarding than any computer game: this blog appears to actually be useful to people and does, in its small way, hopefully, help public libraries and library workers.  Being able to understand what is going on and to get the chance to know or at least meet many of the major characters involved are also bonuses.  And if you do something you enjoy you find the time to do it.  It helps also to have a supportive and long-suffering wife and family (my youngest child, who is eight, cannot remember me without the blog) as well.  So PLN, I guess, is now part of me and it&#8217;s got to the stage now when I&#8217;m not sure what I would do without it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thanks to all of you for supporting the website.

However the UK report could lead to a potential disastrous path: losing the identity of library for an all encompassing whatever they want mentality. So as always, I feel there are lessons here for all libraries, not just ones in the UK.

The community is the collection and needs collection development in the form of nurturing, training, and empowerment. In Chattanooga, and Pisa, and Edmonton, and Wellington librarians are focusing their considerable powers directly on the people they live and work with. These librarians no longer see their role as simply setting a table of knowledge, rather they see their role as hosting a sumptuous feast of shared expertise and experience resident in their communities.&#8221; <strong>R.

Council says &#8220;Some people have looked at the proposals in the budget white paper and suggested the Library of Birmingham was a waste of time and money but I disagree. It’s a world-class, gold standard library and the staff do a brilliant job. The ambition was fantastic and I don’t think we can describe that as a huge waste of money. What we can say is that the decisions taken previously, under a different administration, decisions that saddle us with a huge amount of debt for the building were less than advisable. If we were making those decisions today – with the financial challenges we now face – we may well make very different choices.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;The other thing to remember about community libraries is that they sit within our district structure currently. So, although we know there will have to be some cuts to community libraries, we have to have that conversation, led by local councillors in districts with their local communities.&#8221;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Change\" href=\"https://www.change.org/p/birmingham-city-council-reverse-the-cuts-to-the-library-of-birmingham\"><strong>Birmingham &#8211; Petition: Reverse the cuts to the Library of Birmingham</strong></a> &#8211; Change.org/Friends of the Library of Birmingham. &#8220;We paid in this city for this library.

They are described as community libraries but actually range from small to very busy larger branches.  No library closures  which is really good but of course a library building is different from a library service. Current plans are for librarians posts  to be reduced from 12 to 5 with staff having to compete for remaining posts. Day to day management of library buildings and library staff now to be the responsibility of One Stop Shop Managers.&#8221; <strong>Wirral</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n"
